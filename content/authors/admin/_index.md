I am an associate professor of political science and international affairs at [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu). My research and writing explore how class conflict and compromise intersect with democracy and development. I also have a strong interest in labor standards and understanding how labor unions, nonprofit organizations, consumers and corporations can help to promote them.    

At GW, I teach courses on comparative political economy, data science and South Asia. I am on faculty in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/) and the [Elliott School of International Affairs](https://elliott.gwu.edu/) and am affiliated with the [Sigur Center for Asian Studies](https://sigur.elliott.gwu.edu/) as well as the Institute for [International Economic Policy](https://iiep.gwu.edu/). 

I also serve as one of the managing editors for the [Journal of Development Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fjds20/current).
