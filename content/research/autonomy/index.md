This paper contributes to the understanding of occupational wage inequality in Western
Europe. We assess the effect of worker autonomy, defined as the degree of control workers
have over their own work process, on occupational wage growth using data for 15 European
countries from 2003 to 2018. We present econometric analyses using individual-level wage
data from the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions and find that real wages in
occupations with high autonomy have grown significantly faster than in occupations with
low autonomy. We call this finding an increase in the ‘autonomy wage premium’. Because
workers in high autonomy occupations are at the top of the wage distribution, faster wage
growth in these occupations has increased wage inequality. Using additional worker survey
data, we conjecture about technological, institutional, and demographic determinants of
the autonomy premium. Our analysis suggests that: (i) the autonomy wage premium
increases more in industries and countries with faster technological change; (ii) strong
collective bargaining reduces the autonomy premium, but the autonomy wage premium
rises in countries with strong and weak collective bargaining; (iii) the autonomy wage
premium increases more among older and more experienced workers; (iv) the autonomy
wage premium rises for men and women similarly, but the increase in the autonomy
premium intensifies gender inequality because women are more often employed in low
autonomy occupations.
